# S3 FinTech Data Security Project

## Domain: FinTech

### Problem:
In the FinTech industry, sensitive financial data is constantly at risk of unauthorized access or fraud. Companies must adhere to strict regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of customer financial records. Failure to protect this data can lead to severe legal consequences, loss of customer trust, and financial penalties. As financial institutions manage increasingly large volumes of sensitive data, it's essential to have secure, regulated access controls to mitigate risks.

### Solution:
This project demonstrates how to use AWS S3 and IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies to securely store financial records and restrict access to authorized users only. Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to ensure that only specific teams (e.g., fraud detection teams) can access and manage sensitive financial data. IP filtering is implemented to restrict access to trusted networks.

Additionally, encryption can be applied to protect data at rest, further ensuring that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable without proper decryption keys.

### Key Features:
- **S3 Bucket for Financial Records**: Securely store financial transaction data in S3, with access strictly controlled.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Implement IAM roles and permissions to grant specific access to authorized personnel, such as fraud detection teams or finance department members.
- **Bucket Policy**: Apply S3 bucket policies to enforce access control based on user roles and IP address ranges.

### Implementation:
1. **Create the S3 Bucket**: Securely store financial records in a new or existing S3 bucket.
2. **Define IAM Roles and Policies**: Implement IAM policies to allow access only to specific user groups (e.g., fraud detection, finance teams). This ensures that unauthorized personnel are not able to view or modify sensitive data.
3. **Implement S3 Bucket Policies**: Apply S3 bucket policies that restrict access to the S3 bucket based on user roles and IP addresses (trusted networks).

### Files:
- **`fintech-fraud-detection-policy.json`**: IAM policy for fraud detection team access.
- **`fintech-bucket-policy.json`**: S3 bucket policy for fintech financial records.

### Instructions:
1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Set up the S3 bucket**: Create an S3 bucket for storing financial records in AWS.
3. **Apply IAM policies**: Define and apply IAM policies to restrict access to authorized users (e.g., fraud detection team members).
4. **Set up bucket policies**: Configure the S3 bucket policy to restrict access to the bucket based on user roles and trusted IP ranges.
